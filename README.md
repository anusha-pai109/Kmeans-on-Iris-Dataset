# Kmeans-on-Iris-Dataset

K-means: k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
Here, I have used the K-means algorithm on the Iris Dataset.
